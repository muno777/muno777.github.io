			"That is, instead of communicating \"Player 1 pressed jump\", the client instead sends \"Mario is at position X: 20, Y: 34, and has 5 coins\", and so on.",
			"In this model, each client is responsible for the state of its own player.",
			"At first, it looks the same as before...",
			"01/state_send.gif",
			"...but since you're sending state data, both clients will agree on the outcome at the end.",
			"Notice how Mario still hits the block and gets the coin on P2's screen - even if it looks janky.",
			"This is why in Mario Kart, you can throw a green shell at someone but somehow miss.",
			"Things can look weird due to the communication delay.",
			"01/state_send_blocked.gif",

			"If you're making a fighting game, you don't want anything to look different across the two screens. Everything matters, down to the pixel!",
			"Every method so far (except streaming) has failed to make everything line up the same on both screens.",
			"Luckily, there are ways to achieve this! As a first attempt, what if we delay local inputs to match the delay of network inputs?",
			"In other words, we make Mario's actions delayed on P1's screen, and we make Luigi's actions delayed on P2's screen.",
			"Everything is in sync now!",
			"01/delay.gif",
			"...However, due to the extra input delay, Mario's timing is messed up. He now has to press jump earlier in order to hit the block.",
			"This is a downside of delay-based netcode: your muscle memory for combos and techniques needs to change based on the current network delay",
			"01/delay_blocked.gif",
			"On the plus side, notice that we're not sending any state data anymore - so there's no chance for a client to cheat the game by lying about the state data.",
			"If you try to do a fly hack, the other player doesn't see the result; only button presses are being sent back and forth.",

			"If you want to detect this kind of \"desync\", you can send state data back and forth - but rather than using it to actually facilitate gameplay, instead just compare it.",
			"If there's a mismatch, you know something has gone wrong. This could be from hacking, but it could also be a game bug.",
			"Preventing these mismatches from happening is one of the challenges of this kind of netcode. The game needs to run the exact same on every player's computer.",

			"There exists a type of netcode which prevents cheating like delay-based does, but does not have that nasty input delay.",
			"Its name is spoken only in whispers.",
			"Game devs shudder at the sound of it.",
			"Its name is rollback netcode.",
			"In rollback netcode, you're still sending input data back and forth. However, each input is sent along with a timestamp of when it was pressed.",
			"When the input is received, the client calculates what <i>would</i> have happened if it had received the input on time. Then it \"skips ahead\" to that point.",
			"01/rollback.gif",
			"To really show the effect, here's a gif with double the network delay.",
			"Notice that, on P1's screen, Luigi \"skips ahead\" to the peak of his jump.",
			"It's a lot like missing your cue in a recital and skipping to the middle of the song to get in sync with the others.",
			"This \"teleporting effect\" is the main tradeoff of rollback: you don't experience any input delay on your own character, but these weird artifacts can occur.",
			"01/rollback_big_delay.gif",
			"Also, as a developer, rollback is pretty difficult to implement.",
			"The details are kind of technical, but the basic steps are: 1) keep track of past game states (a \"save state\"), 2) restore a past game state when an input is received (\"reload\" a save state), and 3) resimulate the frames since then but with the new input accounted for.",
			"...All in the span of 1/60th of a second. You're basically adding time travel into your game, and it's gotta run FAST.",
			"Adding rollback to a game is like adding a drive-thru to a restaurant: you need to rethink how everything works in order to enable an entirely different mode of operation.",
			"01/rollback_blocked.gif",
			"Not only that, but you need to rethink your game's logic to account for teleporting. Your code can't depend on things happening in order! Prepare to refactor and bugfix like never before.",
			"And there are design considerations. The teleporting effect is most noticeable on actions with instant startup, so adding some startup time to an action (e.g. squatting down before a jump) can help mask it.",
			"Similarly, introducing input delay on purpose can help mask teleports. When the Slippi team reworked Super Smash Bros. Melee to run on PC with rollback, they managed to get it running faster than on native GameCube hardware - so they could introduce some input delay without affecting players' muscle memory.",

			"In spite of these challenges, rollback is the modern gold standard for fighting games.",
			"It provides a unique combination of perfect cross-client sync, low input delay, and protection against fly hacks.",
			"However, it's not a perfect fit for every game.",
			"Games with persistent worlds or lots of players, such as battle royales or MMOs, will probably benefit more from a server-based model.",
			"And for cooperative games or other low-stakes modes, simple state sharing is probably fine, since players are unlikely to cheat.",
